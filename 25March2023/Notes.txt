Spring:

Spring is a framework which provides an abstraction layer on the 
existing implementations to accelrate application development.

Spring framework comes up with different modules such as Spring Core, 
AOP, Spring MVC, Spring Security....


Spring Core: 

The main responsibility of spring core is Dependency Injection. 

Dependency Injection is done by IOC(Inversion of Control) Container. 

To implement Dependency injection we need to follow composition / aggregation (has-a) relationship.

class A{

}
class B{

}
class C{
  A aa;
  B bb;
}
